# üí´ About Me:
Hi there, I'm Anisha Pal and I'm a frontend engineer with over 2 years of experience. <br>I have always been passionate about technology and programming, and it was this passion that led me to pursue a career in web development.<br><br>Over the last 2 years, I have gained a wealth of experience working on a variety of frontend projects. I have worked on everything from small, single-page applications to large, complex micro frontend applications. <br>Through my work, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have become proficient in using popular frontend frameworks such as React, Next.js and Express.js.<br><br>One of the things I love about frontend engineering is the opportunity it gives me to work closely with designers and UX experts. I believe that a great frontend engineer is someone who can take a design and turn it into a fully functional, user-friendly website or application. <br>I take pride in my ability to not only write clean, efficient code, but also in my ability to work collaboratively with others to ensure that the end product meets the needs of both users and stakeholders.
